# Advent of Code Template

Welcome to the Advent of Code Template repository! This repository serves as a starting point for anyone participating in the Advent of Code challenges from 2015 to 2022. By using this template, you can easily create your own implementation repository for a specific year's challenges by simply clicking the "Use this template" button.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place during the month of December. It consists of a series of daily coding challenges, starting from December 1st and ending on December 25th. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants are encouraged to solve it using their programming skills.

The challenges cover a wide range of programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. They can involve tasks such as parsing input data, implementing algorithms, performing calculations, or solving logic puzzles. The challenges are designed to be fun and engaging, and they often have a festive theme to fit the holiday spirit.

**Please note that Advent of Code is an independent event created by Eric Wastl. Visit the Advent of Code website to learn more and participate directly.**

## Getting Started

To create your own implementation repository for a specific year's challenges, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of the repository page.
2. Choose a name for your repository and provide a brief description if desired.
3. Optionally, choose whether to make your repository public or private.
4. Click the "Create repository from template" button.

Once you've created your implementation repository, you can start solving the challenges for the corresponding year. Feel free to explore and modify the template files to suit your programming language and style preferences. You can also add additional files or directories as needed.

## Structure

The template repository is organized in the following structure:

```
.
├── advent_of_code
│   ├── day1
│   │   └──  README.md
│   ├── day2
│   │   └──  README.md
│   ├── ...
│   └── day25
│   │   └──  README.md
└── README.md
```

- The `advent_of_code` directory contains subdirectories for each day's challenge, from `day1` to `day25`.
- Each day's directory contains an `input.txt` file, which provides the input data for the challenge.
- You can organize your solutions by languages, for example:

```
.
├── advent_of_code
│   ├── day1
│   │   ├──  golang
│   │   ├──  python
│   │   ├──  rust
│   │   └──  README.md
│   ├── ...
│   └── day25
│   │   ├──  golang
│   │   ├──  python
│   │   ├──  rust
│   │   └──  README.md
└── README.md
```

Feel free to organize your implementation repository in any way that suits you. You can create additional directories, modify the file names, or use different programming languages.

## Share Your Solutions

Once you've solved a challenge, feel free to share your solution by pushing it to your implementation repository. You can also participate in discussions, collaborate with others, or showcase your work on platforms like GitHub, Reddit, or the Advent of Code subreddit.

Remember to avoid posting spoilers or sharing direct solutions before the challenge is officially released each day. The event is meant to be enjoyed by participants of all skill levels, so let's keep the excitement and suspense alive!

If you find the Advent of Code challenges valuable and enjoyable, consider sponsoring the event on the [Advent of Code GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/topaz).
